# The Flaky Test Challenge

As an engineer, you will be expected to ensure that all new features and fixes do not cause regressions or headaches for active users. Tests are an important tool for keeping our apps usable and bug-free. However, tests are only useful if they are reliable. This challenge will test your ability to understand and fix a flaky test of a React app.

## The Challenge
